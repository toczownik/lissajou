#A simple application displaying Lissajous figures

The app displays a chart for the following formula:
<br>
x = A\*sin(a\*t), y = B\*cos(b\*t)

To modify the figure, use sliders next to the chosen value. Wne A or B are zero, you will see no figure.
That is because for this values respectively x or y are zero, so the figure is  just an extremely thin line.

The entire program has been done using Qt 5.15 in C++.
